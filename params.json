{"name":"TTTDamagelogs","tagline":"Damagelogs for Trouble in Terrorist Town (a Garry's Mod gamemode)","body":"A highly useful admin tool for Trouble in Terrorist Town which consists a combination of an RDM Manager and well detailed damagelogs to help those cheeky RDMs stand out from normal gameplay. Created by @Tommy228.\r\n\r\n### Main features\r\n* Extra logs (used weapons to damage/kill, item purchases, fall damages, disguiser, teleporter, etc..).\r\n* Colored logs. You can edit the colors clientside from the menu.\r\n* Damage informations. Right click on a damage row, then press \"Show damage informations\". It will show you all the shots of the players of the last 10 seconds.\r\n* Filters.\r\n* Viewing the logs of the previous rounds and previous maps.\r\n* Copying a damagelog line and steamids.\r\n* Viewing the roles of all the players.\r\n* Advanced RDM Manager.\r\n* Death Scene visualisation.\r\n* Spectator Deathmatch compatibility.\r\n\r\n### About the RDM Manager \r\nThe RDM manager is a passive system built into the damagelogs that allows admins to deal with RDM in a timely fashion. When a report is filed, each party involved will be able to write what happened and the victim will have access to the portion of the damage logs involving their death. The accused will not be able to write his side of the story until they die, or the round ends. The victim can view the accused's message and decide to forgive him or not. You will be able to veiw the report, along with any pertinent logs. As an admin, you can then take action against the participants. It is recommended that you discuss how the manager will work with your admins carefully, so that it isn't abused, or used incorrectly.\r\n\r\n### Media\r\n* [Colored damagelogs](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2014/36/1410005854-2014-09-06-00007.jpg)\r\n* [The \"Death Scene\" feature (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zAK6NRBSpw)\r\n* [Shots tab](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2014/36/1410005842-2014-09-06-00006.jpg)\r\n* [Settings](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2014/36/1410005953-2014-09-06-00002.jpg)\r\n* [RDM Manager tabs (for admins](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2014/36/1410005955-2014-09-06-00001.jpg)\r\n* [Reporting a player](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2013/36/1378223568-2013-09-03-00012.jpg)\r\n* [Responding to a player reporting you](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2013/36/1378223559-2013-09-03-00011.jpg)\r\n* [Damage informations](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2014/36/1410005963-2014-09-06-00005.jpg)\r\n* [Old logs](http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/74625700029673724/33262631E2BAECB5C5158F9DC07BA1C54CAD464C/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
